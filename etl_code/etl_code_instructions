I used a MapReduce to Clean my data.

To see the code goto cleaning_code directory.

To run these files I created them in my (non-hdfs) dumbo terminal using vim. I then ran the commands to add them in my class path
	> javac -classpath `yarn classpath` -d . CleanMapper.java
	> javac -classpath `yarn classpath` -d . CleanReducer.java
	> javac -classpath `yarn classpath`:. -d . Clean.java
I then created the jar file
	> jar -cvf clean.jar *.class
Finally I rand the MapReduce Program
	> hadoop jar clean.jar Clean /user/ebw289/finalProject/co2_data.csv /user/ebw289/finalProject/output3

Note that I have a few outputs in finalProject (namely output1, output2, output3). output3 was the one I had used for my analytic, the other were codes I had kept that required more cleaning. To see the results of the run see /user/ebw289/finalProject.
